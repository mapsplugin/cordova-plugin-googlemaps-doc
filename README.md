Cordova GoogleMaps plugin for iOS and Android
==========================
This plugin is a thin wrapper for [Google Maps Android API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/) and [Google Maps SDK for iOS](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios/).
Both [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/) and [Apache Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/) are supported.

You can create a map application that uses native Google Maps with JavaScript, which is faster and uses less data than Google Maps JavaScript API v3.

There are two versions:

## v2.3.0-rc1 (develop version)

You can create multiple maps in your application.
