Cordova GoogleMaps plugin for iOS and Android
==========================
This plugin is a thin wrapper for [Google Maps Android API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/) and [Google Maps SDK for iOS](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios/).
Both [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/) and [Apache Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/) are supported.

You can create a map application that uses native Google Maps with JavaScript, which is faster and uses less data than Google Maps JavaScript API v3.

----

There are two versions:

## v2.2.0 (current version)

You can create multiple maps in your application.
Many bugs are fixed, and many features are improved.

- [Documentation](./v2.0.0/README.md)

- [Full Demo](https://github.com/mapsplugin/v2.0-demo)

- [v2.2.0 Release notes](./v2.0.0/ReleaseNotes/v2.2.0/README.md)


## v1.4.0 (old version)

No longer supported.
