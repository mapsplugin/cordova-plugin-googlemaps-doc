Cordova GoogleMaps plugin for iOS and Android
==========================
This plugin is a thin wrapper for [Google Maps Android API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/) and [Google Maps SDK for iOS](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios/).
Both [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/) and [Apache Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/) are supported.

You can create a map application that uses native Google Maps with JavaScript, which is faster and uses less data than Google Maps JavaScript API v3.

----

There are two versions:

## v1.4.0 (current, but it's an old version)

You can only create one map in your application.

- [Documentations](./v1.4.0/README.md)


## v2.0.0-beta3 (new version, mostly stable)

You can create multiple maps in your application.
Many bugs are fixed, and many features are improved.
But it might be unstable sometimes.

- [Documentation](./v2.0.0/README.md)

- [Demo](https://github.com/mapsplugin/v2.0-demo)

- [Release notes](./v2.0.0/ReleaseNotes/v2.0-beta3/README.md)

### Version 2.0 Beta Roadmap

Version 1.x will be shutdown in 2017.
The date is not decided yet, but v1.4.0 is the last version of v1.x

More details are announced through the [Official community](https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/117427728522929652853)
